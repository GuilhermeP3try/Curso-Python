# Python Studies

This repository contains some of the exercises I'm doing while learning Python.

Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on the basics, including:

- Arithmetic and logical operators  
- User input and output  
- If statements and conditions  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- More coming soon (lists, tuples, dictionaries)

## Why I'm doing this

I'm learning Python to build a strong foundation in programming.  
The goal is to get comfortable with writing code and solving simple problems step by step.

## What's inside

Each file covers a different topic I'm studying. They're named to help me (and others) find things easily.

## Next steps

- Practice with lists and dictionaries  
- Start building small projects (like a simple calculator or password generator)  
- Learn how to read and write files  
- Explore functions and error handling
